Alright. I'm proud to say I've made the switch completely! 2020 is gonna be a good year for us you know what I'm saying? Hehe. anyways my families major liberals and I was growing up around it. I didn't understand one thing, the fact that they always jumped to defensive mode, when something was anti liberal. Which was... Odd. ""To be a good debater you have to be a good listener"". I just dislike what I see in tv with people bashing the right for petty stuff that the left so constantly. Plus Sjws want control on things that shouldnt be controlled. Good example, firearms. there was a famous saying I read about that was big during the creation of our beautiful country and it was something about due to the country being free, we should have free right to bear arms and defend. I'm a Mexican America aswell. And what Trump said WAS NOT racist, not remotely. When he said ""they're brining drugs, rape, etc."" Hes simply saying crimes rose with illegal immigration, you disagree? Lol right because illegal immigration isn't illegal. I'm proud to have made the full switch and I'm also proud to be one of the only religion supporting atheists.... Why? Because having faith is great, who said positivity is wrong lol?

t3_ba25wy,60,"My experience working at a movie theater showing 'Unplanned'
I work at a dine-in theater in the US. We have a movie out called ""Unplanned"" which is a pretty openly preachy movie with a pro-life message. Made by same studio that made ""God's Not Dead"" and ""The Case For Christ"", which aren't exactly cinematic marvels, but still.

Since we got this movie, I've heard so many servers request not to work it, or complain about the 'type of people' that go see that movie. In 2 days, I've heard a girl fear she wouldn't get tipped because she has tattoos (was given a 40% tip). Another girl call the guests racist despite there being no racial undertones to the movie at all to my understanding. A few people complain merely that they have to interact with pro-life/conservative/christians. From my experience the crowd for these movies are very thankful, polite, and tip an above average amount. We have had 0 guest issues in any showing of these movies.

This experience is really just depressing me. So many people genuinely fear conservatives, or don't want to interact with them at all, based on more or less nothing. They're jumping to clearly wrong conclusions about these peoples characters because of the movie they're choosing to watch. By contrast when Michael Moore's recent movie ""Farenheit 11/9"" (yes that title means what you think it means) i only ever got complaints about the movie being shitty and how no one came to it, not personal insults on the people coming to see it",0

Hi all. I'm a conservative that was unfortunately born and raised in Marin County (Bay Area, California).

Since I'm a conservative, however, why is that? If someone moves from a democratic state and is a democrat and continues to vote democratic, then I understand, but being conservative just as they are but still not liking myself moving there is a little weird.

Antonia Okafor, a young, single, black woman, recently discovered that she's a racist, sexist, misogynist. How in the world did this happen? None other than Antonia Okafor explains here in her PragerU video.  

#[Black, Millennial, Female and‚Ä¶ Conservative](https://youtube.com/watch?v=MydjXCHoLo0)  

I recently discovered something startling about myself. It turns out that I‚Äôm a racist, sexist, misogynist. This came as quite a shock to me. How did this happen? As a person of color, a single woman with a graduate degree who grew up poor in a home without a father, I had a clear political path to follow.
And I followed it.  

I voted for Barack Obama...twice. After all, we share the same skin color. His father was from Africa. Mine was, too! What other reasons did I need? I was inspired to see a black man rise to the highest office in the land. I believed his ascent would herald a new beginning, a new era of racial healing and harmony. We would finally have that frank discussion about race that everyone always talks about. I was also inspired by his wife. I was thrilled to see such a strong, opinionated black woman take the national stage. But then something happened... actually, several somethings.  

I realized there was a big contradiction in my own life. I considered myself a free-thinker, but I was thinking exactly what I was supposed to. I decided to start asking questions. I belonged to several campus feminist groups. I was even teaching feminism to inner-city girls. Part of that teaching involved making the case for abortion. These girls needed to know that they had the right to make decisions about their own bodies. Surely, I thought, that‚Äôs empowerment. But one day I asked myself: Isn‚Äôt it men who benefit most from consequence-free sex? Doesn‚Äôt that give them even more power over women? And, of course, abortion certainly doesn‚Äôt empower the women it prevents from ever being born.  

When I began to ask my other feminist friends how they reconciled these issues, they just got angry. I was called anti-woman. Even by progressive men! ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm not anti-woman,‚Äù I thought. ‚ÄúI am a woman!‚Äù I just don‚Äôt want to be a weak one. I want to be strong ‚Äì like Michelle.  

At about the same time, while I was a student at the University of Texas at Dallas, the UT Austin Department of African Diaspora Studies released a statement in which they said, and I quote, ‚ÄúAfrican Americans are disproportionately affected by the saturation of our society by firearms ... We demand that firearms be banned in all spaces occupied by black people on our campus.‚Äù  

Wait a second, I thought. Why would you want to ban firearms only in black areas? Doesn‚Äôt that mean that you either think black people are more dangerous than other people, or less worthy of protection? These questions did not endear me to my progressive friends. I was called a race traitor...even by white people. But I‚Äôm not anti-black. I am black. I just want to be safe ‚Äì like Barack.

I realized I didn‚Äôt have a good answer; I only had more questions ‚Äì like, why were blacks doing so poorly in cities that had been run by Democrats for decades? Was it racism and sexism that was holding people back, or was it something else?   

The more questions I asked, the less popular I became. But here‚Äôs the funny thing: I started to feel better about myself. I decided that the very definition of empowerment required me to take responsibility for my own life. I wasn‚Äôt going to be anyone‚Äôs victim. Which meant I had to protect myself. So, I bought a gun. I started to advocate for gun rights. That cost me more friends. I joined the pro-life movement and walked in The March for Life. More friends...gone.  

Then, I crossed the line. I voted Republican ‚Äì the party that views me as an empowered individual, able to shape my own destiny; not as a member of a victim group.  

And that‚Äôs how I became a racist, sexist, misogynist. I‚Äôm Antonia Okafor for Prager University.

Meanwhile, if I decided to don a MAGA hat and walk the streets of NYC I do not think I'd be met with open individuals who seek to understand my viewpoint and want to empathize with why I feel the way I do. Instead I would be met with reprimands regarding my disrespect to so many people. We have seen enough occurrences on the front page of this subreddit to illustrate this point. 
  
These two issues in my mind illustrate in a very clear way the double standard in our country that is growing daily. When empathy is preached but only from one perspective it becomes easy to regard the other side as less than human and I'm afraid its a dangerous path we are all being pushed down.",0

Obligatory, I am not American and have never visited the states.
American news is spread all over the world and everyone seems to shit on Trump all the time on social media. He is universally viewed as an idiot in my social circle.

I found this sub a couple months ago, to get a different perspective on what goes on in the states because I've already heard everything the liberals have to say from friends news articles and tonight shows etc.

So, Is Trump a good President?
What is your opinion on how he uses Twitter?
Is he draconian for being strict on immigration law?
What do the liberals dislike about Trump and why do you like him (if you do)
And any other opinions on major issues that you'd like to talk about.

I promise this is not some shitpost by some undercover liberal, trying to get a rise out of you. I'm not a 100% sure that this sub is the right place to ask such a question.

I'm genuinely curious

I started at my UNI this semester I want to start telling people about my autism (high functioning) but I also want to be outspoken about being a conservative most people here are liberal. I met one person at the beginning of the semester who was so freaking excited to meet another republican because she had been here a year or so and not met ONE CONSERVATIVE... how sad is that. Anyways... I got inspired so I ordered a shirt that said ""I stand for the flag and I kneel for the cross""  I was wearing this shirt to meet other people that are conservatives here... I met one... in a month of me wearing the shirt (in about a month I wore it 7 or 8 times) I was spit on (he missed bc I moved), tripped, been called a conservative shit, and a couple other things like that.  But because of that one person I knew there were others here and I want them to know that so I just ordered a hat that says TRUMP 2020  its camp and has the flag on it, I really like it. Although If i come out as autistic while also standing up for the republican party more vocally than I've done in the past i feel as though all they will say is ""your autistic... your so stupid, you shouldn't get a say in politics nor do you in my book"" it's basically all I get when I post on reddit about my beliefs...

t3_b98svd,35,"How to debate feminists on abortion
Ask if they support gender selective abortion. In that, a husband and wife are opposed to having a baby girl to the point that they are willing to kill every baby girl they conceive until they conceive a boy. Many abortion advocates claim abortion is solely a women's health issues, but they refuse to answer if they still support abortion when it's used only to selectively kill baby girls. 



If they say it's not a problem morally, ask how it's not a women's health issue to use abortion to only target future women. The United Nations Population Fund and United Nations Sexual and Reproductive Health Agency claim that 126 million pregnancies have been terminated due to sex selective abortion. You can beat them by saying, ""given the fact that 126 million baby girls have been killed because of their gender, saying sex selective abortion isn't a women's health crisis is akin to saying the holocaust wasn't a Jewish health crisis."" 



If they claim it's a rare problem, and shouldn't be used as an argument against abortion, cite eastern Asian and South East Asian nations where the practice has led to a problematic imbalance of men to women, like China. If they admit that is an issue YOUVE WON THE ARGUEMENT, then you can counter with, if aborting a ""clump of cells"" is immoral in the case that it targets only girls, why? If they're just a clump of cell, how is it immoral to selectively target a clump of cells? We selectively target clumps of cells all the time when we treat cancer. Why is targeting a particular clump of cells more or less moral than another clump of cells, unless they aren't just clumps of cells, but future humans. If they are future humans, then all should be valuable, not just potential girls. 



I've raised this argument with lots of pro-abortion advocates on Twitter, and haven't received a straight answer yet. Usually I just get blocked after a couple of points being made.",0

t3_b977su,107,"r/BlackPeopleTwitter is still extremely toxic and the mods seem to be completely disconnected from reality.

   The mods claim they were trying to prove a point about discrimination and segregation but ended up turning people against each other and bringing racists to the front of the sub on both sides. 

    I‚Äôm first going to go over the mods claims and the point they were trying to prove. The mods first claim that because black users complained about racism in BPT and that ‚Äúthe rest of reddit can be overwhelming toxic and racist.‚Äù If actual racism towards blacks was happening on BPT I would understand more but because the subreddit is literally made for the black community I doubt that the ‚Äúracism‚Äù on BPT was anything more than someone saying something stupid and getting downvoted and ridiculed. As for the rest of reddit being racist, I think that‚Äôs a absurd claim considering how left wing some of the biggest subs are and the amount of left wing ideas get put on the front page. However they do cite r/SubForWhitePeopleOnly as an example of racism on reddit, even tho this sub has been removed  and sends you to a anti racism site if you try to reach it. 

   Then the mods tell us how some of the white uses felt as tho it was a crime to be white, well considering it was against the rules to be white than I think that feeling is valid. The mods most likely would not disagree with me here but my problem is that fighting racism with racism only leads to more separation. Obviously they say this whole thing was a joke but this explanation is stupid to me, some jokes are in poor tastes and some are pointless and cruel. Discriminating against all whites because a few were being racist is, even as a joke, is not ok. It really feels like when a YouTube prankster does something shitty and upsets someone and then says ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just a prank bro.‚Äù The point of a prank is so the prankster can have a laugh at a harmless trick, and the pranked can laugh at themselves. The mods took this ‚Äújoke‚Äù so seriously by saying they did it for racial injustice, that it kills whatever joke was being played.

   The mods then go on to say that they feel the same feeling we did when we were banned every day as black people. This is a pathetic attempt to make us sympathetic, telling us that we felt how it feels to walk in there shoes. I don‚Äôt understand this at all, we can understand that it would be very upsetting to be discriminated against without having to be discriminated against. If people changed their minds and started to feel more compassion for the black community then I would understand why they did this whole thing. But as it turns out, and as most reasonable people could‚Äôve predicted, fighting racism with racism caused people to be angry with each other. 

   Which brings me to the after math and what the mods said about it. The mods say that people in BPT were ‚Äúshowing off their individuality and blackness.‚Äù Feeling empowered by the color of your skin is racist no matter which way you look at it from. The aftermath of this was a large group of white users who were extremely upset and a lot of blacks that were happy to join a exclusively black group. I was unsure if it was joke but as I looked through the posts of people trying to get verified I found plenty of examples of people that didn‚Äôt think it was a joke. These people are racist, and I‚Äôll tell you why. If you want to be part of group of exclusively blacks and your group actively discriminates than that makes you part of a racist group. As we know this was only a joke but some black users didn‚Äôt know that and still joined. For the people that aren‚Äôt following just imagine the outrage if any white person tried to join a discriminatory group not knowing that the discrimination was a joke. 

   There has been so much mocking of people in BPT at white people after this had happened. A lot of people are downplaying us being upset even though the mods agree this was a act of discrimination. I‚Äôve seen posts on the top of BPT including racist stereotypes and mocking like 

I also think it‚Äôs hilarious how the mods admit that their actions were racist and discriminatory but the community is still shaming us for being upset about the actions of BPT",0

t3_b8sw0y,178,"I feel like I'm in the twilight zone in my college Sociology class (I wouldn't have bothered taking the class if there wasn't a Diversity Requirement for my degree in Networking)
I'm a middle aged white male who's recently gone back to college after having served in the military for x amount of years. My degree is in Networking, but I am forced to take a ""diversity"" type of class in order to fulfill my graduation requirements... Okay, fine, I never complained about it but thought it was ridiculous in the first place. Anyway, I picked Intro to Sociology.

You know how we make fun of people who say that you can't be racist against white people, or who say that there is no such thing as reverse racism or discrimination because it's being done against people in ""power"" and therefore it doesn't count?

Yea, that shit is being taught seriously in a college setting to young, impressionable kids, and they ARE kids. Kids who have barely left their parents teats and have only experienced school as their primary life experience.

The teacher (a white female) was asking for examples of discrimination or prejudice (this was before she told us the definition of how it doesn't count when it's done against white people). I spoke up and pointed out how Jordan Peele recently stated that he wouldn't be hiring any white male leads anytime soon, and she DENIED that as being an example because he's black and the group he would be doing it against is the majority in power group (white males).

Needless to say, I fought back instantly at that absurd statement in many forms, starting by asking if it was James Cameron who said something like that about black people if it would be prejudice or discrimination then (she answered ""of course!""), then I straight up asked her doesn't that mean it's open season on white people if minorities would never get charged with discrimination or prejudice (she responded with ""it's open season on minorities""...), and finally I just said that Sociology is wrong (which she didn't take too kindly to because she asked why and other students (class is like 70% white) drowned me out defending HER position)). After that, she quickly moved on (at this point class was almost over).

So, long story short, she is teaching the white kids in class that if they have a minority employer or a supervisor who discriminates against them because of the color of their skin that they have no right to complain about it and she is teaching the minorities in her class that if they do discriminate against white people it's okay because Sociology has changed the definition of racism/discrimination/prejudice to mean it can't be done against white people.

It's the most insane shit I have ever heard in my life in a college setting (this is my 3rd college because I move around a lot).

Please, I implore you, if you have kids, you have to warn them about things like this. You have to be there for them and you have to teach them right. 

While Sociology will not be there to defend them, the law will, and that's all that matters.

1. Identify a tradition.
2. Create a grievance class, no matter how small, in opposition to the foundational practices of the tradition.
3. Get organizations of influence, usually professional bodies or government agencies, to recognize the grievance class.
4. Create a plausible case that the practices of the grievance class are normal human variation and should be more tolerated. Suppress any discussion of potentially anti-social problems with the grievance class‚Äô practices.
5. Convert the practices of the grievance class into a status. This is usually accomplished by claiming something innate and immutable about the grievance class.
6. Convert the discussion from one of toleration to one of rights.
7. Use ‚Äúprofessional‚Äù bodies and the courts to construe the new status and rights as within the bounds of existing rights laws.
8. Force everyone to accept the previously anti-social practices of the grievance class.",0

I just want to get this off my chest. I love what Bernie stands for, but I can't in good concience vote for him if I want the democrats to even come close to office next year. We all saw the collusion and chaos of the last election, and I have no doubt that if we try and make him our candidate, it will only happen again. It will most likely be done more secretively and cautiously than last time, but it WILL happen. I'm pretty well versed in politics, and if Russia does/did meddle, we're going to need more than just the democrats on our side-we're going to need a candidate some centrists and republicans would feel comfortable voting for. Beto has a good balance of both, and he has that Texas background republicans just love to put in office (even though he's not an oil and gas supporter).

We have to be realistic- change wil happen one day, but the radical changes Bernie is proposing are not going to be accepted while the generations before the 80's are still around and hold the majority of offices. Beto's platform is very similar, juist not as radical, and therefore more publically acceptable. I'm not forcing anyone to change their mind, i'm just putting my own thoughts out there and opening up conversation.

t3_b6t81q,134,"I find it incredible that someone who conservatives would not want as a friend or business partner is an acceptable president to them.
Trump has lied, done bad business, refuses to call out white supremacy groups as immoral (But is fine with banning Muslims and Mexicans from coming into the US), easily making him not only an immoral president but an immoral person by any standard (and that list is just a start).

So I asked my conservative friend what he thought, and was told this. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like him as a person, and I would never want to do business with him, but I feel like Trump finally stands up for me and my values.‚Äù

I have a kid, and I told my friend that I can‚Äôt believe I have to tell my kid that they are part of a good country with good people overall, when the leader can‚Äôt go a single day without lying. The president is supposed to be our representative to the world, among the best of us, and Trump is not that.

Edit: While Trump does not specifically close borders for racial reasons, he has and continues to call for closing borders or shutting down immigration from certain area that have the same effect. Sources below.

I agree, but when there are direct quotes of him promoting the ideas...

Yes, Jay Inslee is running on climate change, but name an issue and I am happy to describe why he is the real deal. I've been following his stuff for years and he has continued to make me very proud of his lengthy track record of integrity and consistent leadership.

&amp;#x200B;

He supports public K-12 education and prioritized (in addition to climate change legislation) better pay for teachers and funding public education. He fought a gridlocked legislature, so gridlocked it was in contempt of the WA Supreme Court. But he battled through it, fighting alongside the teachers' unions.

He and the WA AG Bob Ferguson made prioritizing protecting refugees a top priority - first he was the first to publicly come out and support welcoming Syrian refugees in 2015 and got a name on himself on NPR and other national media to promote welcoming refugees (and learning shameful lessons from our past, likening it to the Japanese internment camps and worse)

He lost a seat in Congress due to, then continued to champion gun control.

He has promoted a ""Green"" economy or...really, a Washington economy with legalized marijuana and pardoning marijuana crimes.

He signed legislation to make WA the \*first state in the nation\* to support net neutrality.

He has fought for public healthcare and now Washington has expanded its options for public healthcare.

He has fought for better mental health supports for our youth.

This week marks the one year anniversary of Inslee signing the bill to end gay ""conversion therapy"" in Washington and he has been a fierce supporter of LGBTQ+ rights.

He knows his privilege and uses his privilege to dismantle it (good WaPo article on it), conscientiously hiring a diverse work staff, requiring diversity sensitivity training, and is one of the few candidates who has a female campaign manager.

Washington has one of the highest minimum wages in the nation - also under his leadership.

Washington under his leadership has expanded scholarship and financial aid options for DACA recipients.

Inslee went to ICE detention centers to call out the atrocities the Trump administration is committing.

(Did I mention public education? Also his dad was a teacher and his mother was a store clerk; he couldn't afford Stanford so he dropped out before continuing his own education at the UW)

He signed and supported the Indian voting rights act

He has promoted and supported training law enforcement to undergo more de-escalation trainings and other programs to allieviate ongoing bias in criminal justice.

He voted against the Iraq war and overall as a member of Congress received A ratings from LCV, NAACP, NARAL, and many other progressive groups worth noting.

And, for what it's worth, he married his high school sweetheart and they have been together ever since.

&amp;#x200B;

......This doesn't even begin to cover his work on Climate Change, and none of the rest of what I just mentioned above will matter unless we make sure our planet is livable.

There are a bunch of strange coincidences regarding Trump and Russia; unanswered questions that seem to point to nothing other than collusion or attempted collusion/conspiracy. Let's not forget that we've only heard a 4 page summary (given to us by a man who said the president is above the law and who was hired specifically by Trump after expressing his negative opinion of Mueller's investigation) from a massive report spanning 2+ years, 37 indictments, 7 guilty pleas, 199 criminal charges incl conspiracy against the US, 13 Russians indicted for interfering in the 2016 election, 3 Russian businesses indicted and a convicted Russian spy, Maria Butina that infiltrated the NRA and helped arrange a meeting where NRA executives went to Russia and met with oligarchs. They allegedly received tons of money from Russia and also happened to donate $30M to Trump's campaign. 

And let's also not forget about the sex trafficker/massage parlor owner (that Robert Kraft was connected to) who was with Trump at his Superbowl party and was pictured with Trump multiple times along with other GOP congressmen who was selling access to Trump at Mar-a-Lago to Chinese executives and officials. These are very shady things that need to be looked into. Nevermind all the financial crimes and other white collar crimes that Trump has committed over the last 30yrs and all the people he's fucked over like the 100s of contractors and small businesses he screwed after bankrupting 3 casinos, the times he's settled for discriminating against potential buyers of his properties, the Trump University scam that was ripping off students, the illegal immigrants he's taken advantage of for cheap labor and the 4,000+ times he's been sued for fucking over Americans. Anyway, here are those strange, uj hi Jill 8 it 88√≠ stories and sources for each of them.

[Here's the article about a Trump server in the tiny town of Lititz, PA suspiciously communicating 95% of its internet traffic with Russia](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/10/15/was-there-a-connection-between-a-russian-bank-and-the-trump-campaign/amp)

[Here's the article about Jared Kushner and others having their security clearance denied because they were deemed a threat to national security by Republican career security experts and were overruled by Trump's appointee. This has happened only once in the 3yrs prior to Trump but 30 TIMES since Trump appointed Kline. 30 different times people were denied security clearance for being threats to national security and 30 times that was overruled](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/ncna962221)

[Here's the article about Trump's Russian business associate with ties to the Kremlin, Felix Sater, who went to prison for stabbing a man in the face and who wrote a letter to Michael Cohen during the campaign that said ""our boy Donald can get elected...and we can engineer it""](https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/nation/2017/08/28/our-boy-can-become-president-and-can-engineer-trump-ally-said-russia-deal/PXje678sZBqmlP1MzJMHZJ/story.html)

You can't deny that these are very strange incidents and coincidences that need explaining. If the Mueller report exonerates Trump then why is Mitch McConnell blocking Congress from seeing it when just 3 days ago he said they needed to be ""open and transparent"" about the report? If this is such great news for Trump then we should be able to see the full report and not rely on Barr's word, a man who's renowned for getting Republicans out of legal trouble and who said that the president can't commit obstruction because he's basically above the law. Just because there wasn't enough direct evidence to tie the Russian govt to Trump does not mean that Trump is exonerated. ",1

t3_b5o9j1,100,"Went to my first Florida Democratic Party Meeting last night (county level). I have some thoughts...
I'd rather hold off on saying which county, but obviously if you were there, you'll know where I was.

Holy crap, everyone is so old. (No offense).
I'm 30, and the median age had to be 60&gt;. This worries me, as I live in a fairly Democratic area of Florida. Young people (less than 40(!)) Were about 15 strong out of the about 100+ people.

My God, it was boring AF. There was a nice speech by a local council woman, and the president of the county party was nice, but I don't think I learned anything. This meeting was touted as an update to what the Democrats are doing for our county and country, but substance was lacking. Most of the 'updates' were small details about other caucuses or the larger DEC meeting. This also worries me because this would drive out the younger voters. All of what was said in their updates could've been in a news letter. Im sure there were a lot of the older people interested in what was said, but most of the information passed had no action needed behind it. Also, the young Dems speaker was fast and efficient in his speech, but not everyone followed suit.

There is NO information for new candidates. This is something they're working on, but even on the internet, there is no one-stop-shop on what is needed to run for office, or all the requirements, etc.

Finally, I'm not quite sure this Democratic party relates to the younger Dems. I think we have different priorities, different ethics, and see the world differently. I'm hoping more younger Dems come to change the party, but I definitely can see the older generation pushing back on major changes.

I'm hopeful for 2020, and plan on running myself... But I see a lot of concerning issues in the Democratic party for my area of Florida. I'm really hoping we can get some national support, too.",1

* The civil discovery process could be used to force disclosure of Muller's investigative work.   
While Muller did not find enough evidence to file criminal charges, there seems to be enough for a civil trial.

The president was voted in by the electoral college and not a democratic vote, and the republic processes that we use to make decisions about financial use and government priorities has be usurped by the president.

Or, is it safe to conclude that the Mueller Investigation found no collusion, and as surpising as that might be, it's time to accept that the facts show no collusion/can't establish collusion?

I'm really trying to understand why so many on the left see the current definition of civility as a universal good. To me, it seems like an albatross around our necks. Politics is not a playground or a dinner party, and there are real consequences to adhering to civility when others don't. When did we accept civility as some sort of requirement for discourse? Why have we never considered the fact that one person's civility is another's censorship, or the fact that civility is culturally bound and in the eye of the beholder? There are countries where governing bodies physically fight each other. Even the British house of commons has a long tradition of jeering and booing their opponents while they're speaking. 

From my perspective, Michelle Obama said 'when they go low we go high', everybody cheered, and we've been losing ever since. I suspect that if adhering to civility had not been imposed as a requirement on Clinton's campaign against Trump she would have won. The consequences of demanding civility are removing half the arrows from our candidate's quivers- are we willing to lose races in the name of civility? Because that's what's going on.

So I have thought on one thing we can do to make Gerrymandering more difficult  and would like to get some other peoples thoughts on the merits. I share a home with one other adult. As a matter of circumstance, one of us is registered Republican and one is registered Democrat. We both typically vote Democrat.

When Republicans are carving up their districts, is voter registation data used to help them determine how best to disenfranchise us? Does having two conflicting registrations make it more difficult to categorize my address by party affiliation? Essentially, I want to know if these circumstances make my home harder to Gerrymander. If not, are there steps I can take to make it harder for my representatives to know my political leanings?

Once upon a time, impeaching criminals in positions of power was a thing.

Once upon a time, workers had a right to unionize.

Once upon a time, a college education led to prosperity.

Once upon a time, rich people paid taxes.

Once upon a time, being more prosperous than your parents was likely.  

Once upon a time, there was a free country that aspired to much and achieved the impossible many times over.

Once upon a time, elections were decided by voters.

(Edit: Brigaded, unsurprisingly.  Share far and wide if you agree with the points made here, and feel free to outright plagiarize.)

---

The media has continued its relentless campaign of normalization and rationalization in the wake of the New Zealand terrorist attack - the umpteenth Nazi murder spree worldwide since Putin's 2016 coup installed Donald Trump in power.  Some of the more obscene examples:  

**White nationalists** is a term that's become ubiquitous.  On *this* planet, they're Nazis.  White supremacists, if you want to be descriptive.  These have been standard terms for them pretty much for all of living memory, but suddenly - around the time Putin's coup gave the Nazis power - this other term is everywhere, seemingly written in stone.  

The reason is plain: It's normalizing rhetoric.  There are all sorts of types of nationalists, and the word has ""nation"" in it, so it automatically has normalized or even positive connotations for many people.  See, calling mass-murdering terrorists ""white supremacists""...**would be too negative**.  To call something what it is would be taking sides (aka objectivity; aka, journalism), and now that the Nazis have power again in the form of Republicans, suddenly they're supposed to be treated like a legitimate side.

**Trump administration**.  *What* ""administration""?  People who work for major media organizations are generally educated to a level that a sane person would call adequate, so they can see as plainly as anyone else that there is no ""administration.""  There is no ordered group of professionals tasked with implementing laws.  It's a plain fact.  There are simply a bunch of criminal individuals doing whatever they please, or whatever Donald Trump pleases, without regard to laws, rules, or norms of any kind.  *Regime*, *insurgency*, or related terms are the correct usage.

So why do they keep saying ""administration""?  Are they clinically delusional?  Again, it's just normalizing rhetoric.  Nothing to see here, folks!  The US Executive branch has *not* been overthrown by a Russian dictator!  The Constitution is totally still in effect!  See, it's just a bad *administration*, nothing worse than that.  Just like the Putin administration and the Kim Jong-Un administration, both of which the Trump ""administration"" adores.  

Yup, it's just a plain old *administration* that just happens to commit felonies with impunity on a daily basis, has privatized key functions of government under personal rule, and openly incites terrorist attacks by Nazis against the American people (and others worldwide), but other than that, totally an administration!  In the same way that sometimes people get a ""cold"" that requires treatments resulting in hair loss, vomiting, and death.

And what are those things called that this ~~regime~~ ""administration"" supported by ~~Nazis~~ ""white nationalists"" does?  Why, **policies** of course!  Anything an *administration* does is by very nature a *policy* - it's nice, normal, and authoritative, like something that a totally-not-insane person came up with through an actual process of rational thought and discussion.  Calling them *crimes* by default would be too ~~objective~~ biased and even just saying *actions* would fail to lend the ~~regime~~ ""administration"" the legitimacy the media is determined to give it.

So, some people doing whatever they please, ignoring all laws and norms, and regularly contradicting themselves when it suits them - these acts are **policies**.  

Does this mean that every random meth-head who disembowels a cat in front of a group of horrified cafe patrons is also enacting a *policy*?  Of course not, because there's no power involved.  Power requires that legitimizing language be used to describe what is done, regardless of fact.  Now, if *Donald Trump* disemboweled a cat on TV and played around with its guts while screaming a rendition of ""Yankee Doodle Dandy"", *that* would be described by the media in the following way:

**""Trump administration's controversial animal rights position draws fire from critics"".**

Why are they doing this?  Are the media literally insane?  Nope, just utterly corrupt, cowardly, and nihilistic.  Quite simply, the news media business model is rooted in the construction and control of dichotomies, and when the truth is too plain to exploit, they simply can't use it - there's nothing left to say after the facts have been reported.  No yammering, no false equivalencies, no intellectual version of gladiatorial circus combat.  They would be reduced to half-hour news programs again rather than 24 hours of bullshit, and lose billions of dollars.  

But if they pretend that evil, crazy people are a ""side,"" that WW2 and the Holocaust never happened, that chaotic criminal insurgencies are administrations, that crimes are policies, and that lies are opinions, everything becomes monetizable.  At least until Glorious Leader shuts down the circus and just has wall-to-wall praise of himself at gunpoint, but by then everyone who matters will have moved their money and their families somewhere safe from the nightmare they helped midwife.

Which is not to say we are not to blame in any of this.  Normalizing rhetoric works because people want it, crave it - they choose it over reality.  Why?  Because reality demands agency.  It demands participation, and responsibility.  **""Here are the facts.  Now the ball is in your court""** makes people feel anxious, especially when the facts are *this* grim.  And not the entertaining kind of anxious that people enjoy, waiting to see what's next on a TV show - waiting for some proxy in Washington to make some bon mot at Trump's expense.

The reality that our civilization is under attack by Nazis AGAIN - you may be aware of the last time it happened, when 50 million people died - is not something people want to hear.  They didn't even want to hear it the *first* time, and a bunch of countries actually surrendered to it rather than face it - and, as galling as it is, plenty of Americans want to surrender as well.  They would rather hear their cancer diagnosis spoken of as a bad cold than really confront anything, and that's cowardly and infuriating.

So, folks, the questions to ask yourselves would be - are you a free, rational, responsible person?  Do you want the things you say to be true, based in the terms that respect reality?  Then these terms don't exist to you for foreseeable future in reference to current-day Republican politics:

* White nationalist.

* President / Presidency.

* Administration.

* Policy.

They're **Nazis** or **white supremacists**.  

Donald Trump has no title in this country or any other but his own beshitted name, so don't go around robotically saying ""President Trump"" or ""the President"" as if that office even exists right now.  

He is, moreover, the figurehead (not even leader) of a **regime** or **insurgency** - there is no ""administration"" in this country above the state level.  

And the things he and his accomplices do are **crimes**, or at most general, **acts** - there are no ""policies"" involved.

Un-fuck your language and get back to planet Earth while we still have one, and tell the media to do the same. ",1

This is an interesting article on the NPR website, today.

https://www.npr.org/2019/03/11/701205836/trump-administration-shortcuts-science-to-give-california-farmers-more-water



Today, I was mulling the whole puzzle of why Republicans consistently deny global warming.

It must have to do with their base.

But what is the actual motivation?

This article discuses one tiny facet that represents a whole host of issues that matter to the livelihoods of people in red regions of the country.

Is it the fact that small farmers are always living hand to mouth, and extra water can make all the difference to whether or not their crop survives. I have heard that arguing for your water rights can be brutal in dry regions.

If you want more alottment of water a landowner needs to go to court to argue his case side by side with his neighbors and other interest holders.

We can all applaud Greta Thunberg's efforts in Europe to lobby for action in regards to climate change. We can all cheer when Monsanto' glyphosate gets called into question and becomes banned across Europe. We can all feel relieved when ""Ag gag"" laws which prevent whistle blowing on factory farms are successfully challenged in court. 

However, one needs to understand the plight of the family farmer and sympathize with those individuals. Otherwise, you get this big balkanization within US national policy making.",1

House Dems pass 'power grab' voting rights bill; McConnell says proposal has no chance in Senate

https://www.foxnews.com/politics/house-democrats-pass-sweeping-voting-rights-bill



Summary off bill reported by Fox News:
The proposal¬†-- nearly 700 pages -- calls for¬†Election Day to be designated a federal holiday, requires all states to offer automatic voter registration, restores voting rights to convicted felons, institutes independent redistricting commissions to weed out gerrymandering and requires nonprofit organizations to disclose the names of donors who contribute more than $10,000 in an effort to rein in dark-money groups. .




How in the world is this a power grab or remotely bad. Sure some specifics maybe need to be clarified which i assume are in the 700 pages but their (fox news) own report summary isn't negative. Yet the title and the article tries to demonize it. 


I get the whole left vs right nonsense but this is absurd to call a power grab. I don't know how to rationalize the article, how is this not the onion.
